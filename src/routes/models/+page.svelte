	     The byline carries the one catalog-level fact not visible in the list
	     itself: how fresh the curation is (the newest family's release month).
	     The standfirst states what the catalog is (a curated shortlist,
	     everything runs in the app) so the list below reads as a
	     recommendation, not an attempt at completeness. -->
